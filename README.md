# Implementation of 3D processing algorithms in C++, with LibIGL

![](ICPRegistration/media/giphy.gif)

Two projects, with implementations of different algorithms of 3D processing of meshes and point clouds : 
- Iterative closest point registration for point clouds : [repo](ICP-Registration)
- Mesh curvatures, Laplacian mesh smoothing, and spectral reconstruction for meshes : [repo](Laplacian-Smoothing-and-Spectral-reconstruction)

Code from courseworks and projects of my Master's degree course.
